## Simon Hempenstall

**Junior developer, actively seeking work. Recent graduate of Makers Academy, Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp.**  

I got my first taste of coding several years ago while working as a primary school teacher. There I learnt how to use Scratch to teach children the basics of programming. This sparked an interest in coding that has grown ever since. I left teaching a few years ago to work for a digital education company, where I was employed as a senior advisor for their website. In this role I got the chance to work alongside experienced software engineers and learnt some basic HTML / CSS. I quickly realised I wanted the developers jobs and I was in the wrong team! 

I’ve always loved building things and working on projects. Programming satisfies my love of making things while simultaneously building up a valuable technical skill set. After Makers I'll be looking to start my first junior developer role in an ambitious, socially responsible company, who are as enthusiastic about software development as I am. I want to join a team that will support but also challenge me on a daily basis to help me best evolve as a developer.    

## Skills

#### Creative

As a keen musician with a fine art background, I'm used to taking a creative approach to problem solving and enjoy dealing with abstract concepts. Inventive thinking can be very powerful when writing clean code for complex programs and this is not something I shy away from. 

#### Attention to detail

From marking students work to event organisation, having a keen eye for the fine details has been vital in my previous professional roles.

#### Initiative 

I've always been a pro-active person, good at spotting opportunities and finding solutions to problems. When I completed my undergraduate degree I was offered a job teaching English in Busan, South Korea. After 3 months of living there, the academy where I worked had to close due to financial difficulties. Instead of returning home, I managed to resolve visa complications and found a new teaching job, despite having very few contacts in Korea at that time.          

#### Team player 

While I am self-motivated and work well off my own initiative, I often find working collaboratively yields the best results and is something I really enjoy. I have direct experience of this from my teaching background, where planning lessons with colleagues and sharing effective pedagogical techniques, continually produced the best results in the classroom. At TES Global I worked as part of a close team who saw the first digital teaching resources marketplace launched on time, budget and with targets exceeded.

- **Diving, snorkelling** I'm an animal lover and have had a lifelong fascination with sea-life (for some unknown reason!).

- **Travelling** Living abroad for two years definitely gave me the travel bug and I'm always looking for excuses to jump on a plane to explore a new corner of the world.
