## Simon Hempenstall

**Currently learning to code at Makers Academy, Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp.**  

I got my first taste of coding several years ago while working as a primary school teacher. There I learnt how to use Scratch to teach children the basics of programming. This sparked an interest in coding that has grown ever since. I left teaching a few years ago to work for a digital education company, where I was employed as a senior advisor for their website. In this role I got the chance to work alongside experienced developers and learnt some basic HTML / CSS. I quickly realised I wanted their jobs and I was in the wrong team! 

I’ve always loved building things and working on projects. Programming satisfies my love of making things while simultaneously building up a valuable technical skill set. After Makers I'll be looking to start my first Junior Developer role in an ambitious, socially responsible company, who are as enthusiastic about software development as I am. I want to join a team that will support but also challenge me on a daily basis to help me best evolve as a developer.
